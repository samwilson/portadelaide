==Life==

Patrick Dowd was born on 10 March 1881 at Peterborough South Australia, to parents Andrew Dowd and Rose Ann Dowd (nee Brady).  He married Elizabeth Anne (nee Baynes).

Dowd was a horse-shunter for Mallyons. He had a quiet unassuming disposition, was very popular with his work mates and respected and liked by all with whom he came in contact. He took a prominent part in the affairs of the Drivers Union having been a member of the executive committee.

On 20 June 1916 he enlisted in the 1st AIF, leaving South Australia on 28 August on the SS A68 ''Anchises'' with the 20th Reinforcements, 10th Battalion, and arriving in Plymouth on 11 October.  On 18 December he sailed for France on the SS ''Golden Eagle'' to join the 27th Battalion.  He suffered a severe gun shot wound to the arm on 3 March 1917, was admitted on the ninth ambulance train and then transported on the HS ''Formosa'' to Reading War Hospital in England.

Dowd was discharged from hospital on 5 May and sent back to France on 15 June where he rejoined the 27th Battalion.  

In a letter dated 12 August written to the drivers, he stated he expected to return to the firing line shortly, having completely recovered from wounds he had received in a previous battle

Private Patrick J Dowd (No 6239) was killed in Belgium on September 20 1917.

His memorial is recorded on Ypres (Menin Gate) Memorial, Belgium, panel reference 7 - 17 - 23 - 25 - 27 - 29 - 31.
