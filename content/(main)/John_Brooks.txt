PORT ADELAIDE FRIENDLY SOCIETIES' DEMONSTRATION.
A grand demonstration and athletic sports meeting in connection with the friendly societies of Port Adelaide was held on the Alberton Oval on Easter Monday and proved, though to a certain extent an innovation, a success. In past years it has been customary for the Independent Order of Oddfellows to have a picnic as a separate order during Easter; but the managing committee, deeming wisely that union is strength, determined on a united demonstration this year, and it is proposed to make it an annual affair, the proceeds accruing from the sports to be used towards defraying the expenses of a recreation ground for the Port friendly societies. The Manchester Unity of Oddfellows is the oldest lodge in the Port, and is both numerically and financially the strongest having a membership of 680; Court Concord, A.O.F., ranking second with 528 members The Court Australia's Pride, A O.F., has a total membership of 340 members ; the Loyd Peninsula, 140 ; and the Juvenile Concord's Pride, A.O F., 104. The Duke of Portland and the Duke of York, G U.0.F., and the Hibernians, have also a good percentage of members. The men turned out in regalia, and when they formed in processional order with their banners and bands the scene was striking. The line of march was up Ship street down St Vincent street, traversed Commercial road, and thence to the oval. Victoria Lodge, Accorn Lodge, U. A O.D. Messrs. J. Bennett P.A;; J. G. Brooks,

AMBULANCE DEMONSTATION
In the Port Adelaide Town Hall on Wednesday evening a demonstration was held to mark the inauguration of tbe system of ambulance suggested by the Mayor (Mr. J. H. Clouston), and consummated by a representative committee of the medical, shipping, and labour interests. 
The Mayor, who presided over a good attendance, gave a short retrospect of the work entailed in bringing the movement to a successful issue. In 1911, when he was elected, he went into the question of bringing the scheme, which had previously been considered and abandoned, to fulfilment. In December, 1911, he had interviewed Mr. Connor, and had obtained from him valuable information. In 1912 the Port Adelaide Trades and Labour Council deputed five of their number to co-operate with the local council in forming a foundation committee. When that was achieved the local medical men were approached, and they suggested a system of hand ambulances. To secure these £460 was required. The committee had worked hard and well. Of the money collected local societies, had contributed £108. (Hear, hear.) Thirteen ambulance litters were built from plans approved by the medical men, and medicine chests, containing books of instruction and necessary items for the treatment of sufferers had been secured. Mr. J. E. Stephens (Secretary) presented a balance sheet. 

Mr. H. D. Gell (President of the St. John Ambulance Association) presented certificates to the following successful candidates:— Messrs. T Arthur, J. G. Brooks, , J. E. Stephens,
