Margaret Carr was the wife of the Hon John Carr MLC.  She was born in Port Adelaide on June 20 1873 to John and Mary Thomas.  She and her brother were orphaned at an early age and raised by older married sisters.  Margaret married John in 1893 and they had four children, Florence, William, John and George.

Margaret was a tireless worker and canvasser for the Labor Party and Port Adelaide community as were many other women.  She worked for Norman Makin during his election for the federal seat of Hindmarsh assisting elderly people to attend polling booths.  

During the depression Margaret ran soup kitchens for the needy in Port Adelaide particularly at the Marist Brothers School opposite the Portland Hotel.

SOUP FOR SCHOOL CHILDREN
The Rev. T. P. Willason who is in charge of the Port Adelaide Central Mission, has been concerned at signs that the lack of vegetable food is affecting the health of school children whose fathers were unemployed. To make good the deficiency a soup kitchen will be opened in about a fortnight at the former school of the Marist Brothers on the Port-road. Children attending the Port Adelaide Central School will be able to obtain a bowl of soup at the lunch-time recess. Mr. J. McGowan of Robert-street, Sandwell, is acting as organiser of the kitchen. Donations of money, vegetables or meat sent to his address or to Mr. Willason at the Mission in Dale-street will be welcomed. Last year Mr. Willason secured donations of about 100 tons of firewood; from farmers of the Pinnaroo district for the relief of distressed families at Port   Adelaide. He left for Pinaroo on Thursday and hopes to obtain a repetition of the contribution of firewood for the pre sent winter season.
