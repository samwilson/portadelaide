From ''The Herald'', August 11 1900
<blockquote>
It was with deep regret that we had to chronicle the death of an old and tried worker in our last issue. Mr. Thomas Carr was well known and respected in Labor circles at Port Adelaide, and the news of his sudden death on the 27th ult. was received with widespread regret. The deceased was first a sailor and then a stevedore, and those who had worked with him speak of him with the utmost respect; he was a good mate and a white man to the core. 

He was one of the foundation members of the Working Men's Association, and was selected at a large meeting, held in the Port Adelaide Town Hall in 1872, as one of a committee to draft rules for this association. He was elected one of its first trustees, and held office for a number of years. Subsequently the deceased was appointed caretaker of the Working Men's Hall and custodian of the property of the association. For twenty-two years he filled this position, living in a cottage on the property of his employers. Faithfully and diligently he performed his duties, death only severing his connection with the trades union which he had helped to build up. 

In early life Mr. Carr was in the merchant service, afterwards joined the Royal Navy, and saw a great deal of service on the China station. Leaving the navy, he came to South Australia, and was engaged for some years in the coasting trade in the early days of the colony. Subsequently he took to stevedoring, and followed that occupation until he received the appointment previously mentioned. 

In 1864 he joined the Foresters' Friendly Society, and was a foundation member of the Court Concord Lodge. During his long connection with this lodge he made many warm friends, and his sudden death was a great shock to the brethren. He was a good old loyal subject, with his soul still in the old service; and when the first contingent was raised for South Africa he expressed a good deal of annoyance at the delay which occurred and the conflicting opinions expressed. 

The funeral took place on Sunday, July 29, accompanied by one of the biggest processions ever seen in Port Adelaide. It started from Dale Street, headed by 50 of the "Protector" boys in uniform, accompanied by a large number of Foresters in regalia, about 300 members of the Working Men's Association, and a number of prominent citizens of the Port. The Rev. Mr. Cuthbert was the officiating minister.

The deceased leaves a widow, one daughter, and eleven sons to mourn their loss. One son went with the "Protector" as an A.B. on Monday last. Our late brother was a most conscientious and consistent advocate of the rights of labor, a sound unionist, and was, as an old friend said at the last sad scene, "a good mate, scrupulously honest, and a white man through and through."</blockquote>
