MARINE COOKS

The Port Adelaide agent of the Federated Marine Cooks. Bakers, and Butchers' Association (Mr. T. R.

MARINE COOKS AND PART TIME

The secretary of the Marine Cooks and Stewards' Association (.Mr. T. R. Griffin) said yesterday that although steamship owners had declined to give seamen a guarantee of re-employment if they adopted a rationing plan of one month off in six, ships' cooks were already working under such a scheme. A number of unemployed ships' cooks at Port Adelaide had "secured two or three months' work under this system. After being off duty for a month, the cooks resumed their position under an agreement with the Commonwealth Steamship Owners' Federation. The scheme was operating on interstate and coastal vessels of the Adelaide Steamship Company. 

The owners have taken a different attitude on the rationing of seamen however, because of the greater difficully in arranging the crews.

FOOD SENT TO STRANDED CREW

A fortnight's provisions has been sent to the stranded 4,500-ton freighter Dundula in preparation for a long wait while the dispute over rates of pay for tug crews is being settled.

CAPTAIN H. J. M. Phoenix, Port Adelaide superintendent and   manager of the Adelaide Steamship Co., announced today that this step had been taken.   The Dundula, which had anchored about four miles from Kingscote, Kangaroo Island, because of a defect in its steering system, had a complement of about 40 he said. When two tugs were sought on Thursday to go to the vessel's assistance, full crews were not available.
