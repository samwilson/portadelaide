MRS. C. FOX

Mrs. Foxâ€¦  was born in Victoria and came to South Australia a little over seven years ago. She has been a staunch supporter of the Labor movement for many years. When she was leaving Maryborough, where she worked for 15 years, the mayor, on behalf of the citizens, presented her with a silver tea set in recognition of the good work she had done in the district.
Mrs. Fox and family came to Rosewater from Broken Hill, and immediately joined the Labor movement. She has been one of the most earnest workers for Democracy associated with the Labor movement in Port Adelaide and no Labor entertainment seemed complete unless she was connected with it. 

Although Mrs. Fox had a son at the front she took a big part in the fight against conscription. She was well known in Port Adelaide and the surrounding districts. and made a large number of friends. For several years Mrs. Fox represented the Rosewater branch of the U. L. P., as it was then called, as a delegate to the Labor Party Conference. She was also president of the Rosewater women's branch before it amalgamated with the men's section. Besides being a delegate to the council of the Labor Party, Mrs. Fox was the president of the Port Adelaide women's branch

Mrs. Fox left a husband, four daughters (Mesdames Hudson, Gippsland; A. Guthrie, Exeter; and E. W. Fox, Wallaroo; and Miss G. Fox, Rosewater, and two sons (Messrs. R. S. and R. H. Fox,   the latter a returned soldier). Her   funeral will take place this afternoon.  Daily Herald, April 16 1918
