==Life==
According to the Roll of Honour circular<ref>[http://www.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1068882--406-.pdf Roll of Honour circular] For the First World War the circulars were forms sent to next of kin seeking details regarding the deceased. They form the basis of the card indexes from which the Australian War Memorial's original Roll of Honour was compiled.</ref> filled out by his widow for the Memorial War Museum, William Mann was educated at a "Public School" in England and emigrated to Australia "23 years ago", thus presumably in around 1894. She gave his age at the time of death as being 41, rather than the 43 years and 3 months inferred from his enlistment records.


==Legacy==
William Mann was nominated for the [[Workers' Memorial, Port Adelaide|Workers' Memorial]] by the [[Federated Engine Drivers and Firemen Association]] as one of the eight unionists who had been killed in World War I.
