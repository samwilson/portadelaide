Robert Alfred Collins

South Side

Name added to memorial 2007

He was nominated by the Port Adelaide Federal Electorate Committee

Robert Alfred Collins was born August 5 1928 at Cowandilla.  His sense of Social Justice came from real life experiences during the Depression and WWII and the subsequent reconstruction of Australia.

His Eulogy:

Bob Collins lived a good life
:He was a good man
:He did good things for others
:And he did so without seeking praise or recognition
:Wisdom and enlightenment comes to those 
:who can forgo ego, status, fame and ambition

He lived most of his life at Seaton, attending Seaton Park Primary School and Croydon Technical School, and then serving an apprenticeship as an electrician at Mayfields in the city.  He later worked at the Onkaparinga Woolen Mill on the Torrens River at Thebarton before returning to Mayfields.  Bob then worked for Telecom.  He assisted with the training of apprentices and attended night school to improve his qualifications as an Electrical Engineer

Bob was married to Shirley and they were both members of the Orchid Society of South Australia

Bob joined the labor Party in the mid 1960’s where his position within the seats of Lee and Port Adelaide Branches grew.  He became Treasurer, fundraising and organising memorable picnics at Cheltenham and Angle Park when Mick Young became the Federal Member in 1974 and managing and administering the purchase and running of the Colac Hotel through a company run by John Doyle.

Bob Collins worked for Kevin Hamilton, the member for Lee from 1979 – 1992 and was awarded life membership to the ALP in 1997.  He had a lengthy association and involvement with the Churchill Fellowship and assisted with the Mick Young Scholarship (originally the Port Adelaide Scholarship Trust) which helps young people to advance their educational qualifications and employment prospects.
