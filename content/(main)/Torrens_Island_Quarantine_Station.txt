The '''Torrens Island Quarantine Station''' (TIQS) was established on its present location on [[Torrens Island]] in 1878 to protect the colony of South Australia from the arrival of disease, principally [[wikipedia:Smallpox|smallpox]]. The station was kept in readiness and activated as required until 1980, when it was closed due to the World Health organisation having declared that smallpox had been eradicated globally in the previous year.

The island has also been used for animal quarantine purposes. After TIQS was closed for human quarantine, the site was taken over by the adjoining [[Torrens Island Animal Quarantine Station]] (TIAQS), until most of this activity was transferred interstate in the early 1990s. 

==History==

Being largely uninhabited, an island, adjacent to [[Port Adelaide]], and near [[Outer Harbor, South Australia|Outer Harbor]], Torrens Island was initially used as the site of a Quarantine Station for new arrivals (by sea) to South Australia.<ref name="weekendnotes">D. Walsh:[http://www.weekendnotes.com/torrens-island-quarantine-station/ Torrens Island Quarantine Station] ''Weekendnotes'', 4 July 2013. Accessed 17 July 2013.</ref> One example of its use was during the so-called "[[wikipedia:Boonah crisis|Boonah crisis]]". 

Besides the adjacent animal quarantine station, there were two human quarantine stations on the site at different times; the surviving Torrens Island Quarantine Station is listed on the [[wikipedia:South Australian Heritage Register|SA Heritage Register]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://apps.planning.sa.gov.au/HeritageSearch/HeritageItem.aspx?p_heritageno=17297 | title=Torrens Island Quarantine Station (including Jetties, Cemetery, Mortuary & Complex) | publisher=Department of Environment, Water and Natural Resources | work=South Australian Heritage Register | accessdate=12 February 2016}}</ref>

==The Friends of Torrens Island==

After ownership of TIQS was transferred to DPTI, in June 2016 the [[Friends of Torrens Island]] community volunteer group signed a Licence Agreement with DPTI which gave the group a role in looking after the site. Since 2017 FoTI has been assisted in this role by Conservation Volunteers Australia.
