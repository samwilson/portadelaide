SWEET CHARITY'S SAKE.

From time to time the workers of Port Adelaide have raised large amounts to relieve cases of distress in the district. Recently the fact was brought under their notice that the widow and six children of the late Mr. James Ridan were in straitened circumstances. A committee, consisting of Messrs. P. J. Ryan (Chairman). F. P. Easter, T. T. Thompson, J. E. Martin, E. P. Turner, N. Nelson, and F. L. Clifford (honorary secretary), representing the Waterside Workers' Federation, (Messrs. T. Dixon, M. Wiltshire, J. E. Stephens, G. Bevan, R. Powing. S. Cilento, and E. O. Oates (representing the Port Drivers and Carters' Union), and Mr. Frank Condon are at work arranging for a football match between the Waterside Workers' Federation and the Port Carters and Drivers, to be played on the Alberton Oval on September 1. The match promises to be a first-class one, and in addition there will be a trotting exhibition, foot racing, and a gymnastic display. The Port Adelaide Philharmonic Band will also assist. The time it will take a certain candle to burn out will form the subject of a guessing competition, in connection with the scheme for raising funds for this needy case.

TRAGIC HAPPENINGS FOR THE WEEK.

A HORSE-DRIVER KILLED. DRAGGED FROM HIS TROLLY.

About 6 p.m. on November 8 the police took charge of a man who was found lying on the Port-road, opposite the Mounted Police barracks. Constable Finn took the man to the Adelaide Hospital and ascertained from him that he is Thomas Dixon of Spring-street, Queenstown, and is a horse-trolley driver in the employ of Messrs. Gambling Ltd. It was ascertained, that Mr. Dixon was on his way to Port Adelaide from the city with a four-horsed load when he was dragged of the seat and fell on the roadway, the wheels passing over him. Several bystanders saw the accident and went to his assistance. At the hospital it was found that Mr. Dixon was suffering from a crushed pelvis and shock, and he died half an hour after being admitted. On the way to the hospital he enquired where he was being taken and asked that his wife be informed.
