:'''4.4.2 Reptiles and Amphibians'''
:Seventeen reptiles have been recorded from the Torrens Island area (Table 6). Two of these are Sea Turtles, which do not nest on the island and would at most be misplaced vagrants in the waters surrounding the Island. Most of the remaining fifteen species could possibly be present on Torrens Island, with seven species having been recorded on the Island in the past. Most of the reptile species require structure for shelter at the ground level, such as fallen timber, leaf litter, open shrub, grass and groundcover understorey. Management actions need to ensure that these microhabitats are retained or improved.

==Amphibians==

:There are no records of amphibians from Torrens Island, but four species have been recorded within a 5km radius of the extent of the Island. Given the close proximity of the sea to the site, and the lack of freshwater pooling to allow eggs and tadpoles to mature, it is considered unlikely that any frogs are present on Torrens Island. The two species that might possibly be present are the burrowing species ''Neobatrachus pictus'' and ''Limnodynastes dumerilii''.
