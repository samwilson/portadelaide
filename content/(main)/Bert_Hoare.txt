Ex-shearer upholds men

Albert who had been a shearer 20 years earlier supported the shearers in their fight to guarantee law that shearers shall be provided a decent bed to sleep in instead of any sort of makeshift.  Mr. Hoare said when he was a shearer, you slept where you could usually two or three tier bunks.  I do not know of any work harder or more unhealthy than shearing and the men should be looked after he said.  

 Advertiser October 1947
