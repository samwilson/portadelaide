The [[Section Bank]] (also known as Bird Island), north of the Outer Harbor breakwater, now has the second largest pelican breeding colony in South Australia, with 1,200 nests in 2016.<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-01-29/man-made-island-provides-creche-for-pelicans-at-port-adelaide/7124782?section=sa Man-made island results in booming cr√®che for pelicans at Port Adelaide] ''ABC News'', 29 January 2016, Retrieved 31 January 2016.</ref>
