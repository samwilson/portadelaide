On the evening of Monday 9 May 2016, a storm event caused by an intense low pressure system in the Southern Ocean resulted in extensive damage, especially along the coastline of Metropolitan Adelaide, and at other localities in South Australia.


==Preparation==
On Friday, 6 May 2016, the Bureau of Meteorology issued a severe weather warning for the coming weekend, for  widespread heavy rain up to 80mm in some areas  north of Maree,<ref>[http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/bureau-of-meteorology-issues-flood-warning-for-far-north-of-south-australia-ahead-of-forecast-heavy-rain/news-story/2b7432f16e2de2fb600007abe8a4820a Bureau of Meteorology issues flood warning for Far North of South Australia ahead of forecast heavy rain] ''The Advertiser'', 6 May 2016.</ref> and damaging winds with gusts of up to 100km/h, in 10 districts including Adelaide, Mt Lofty Ranges, Yorke Peninsula and Eyre Peninsula.<ref name=Adv2016-05-06>[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-05-06/heavy-rain-and-possible-flooding-forecast-for-sa/7392190 South Australia faces heavy rain, possible flooding over weekend, weather bureau predicts] ''The Advertiser'', 6 May 2016.</ref>

==The storm==
The Metro area was buffeted by strong wind gusts, of up to 87km/h at Adelaide Airport,<ref>[http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/dwo/201605/html/IDCJDW5001.201605.shtml BoM > Adelaide Airport, South Australia May 2016 Daily Weather Observations]</ref> and gusts of around 100km/h were reported from Murray Bridge, and Cape Willoughby on Kangaroo Island.<ref name=ABC2016-05-09 />

As the storm coincided with a spring tide, with the predicted astronomical tide expected to peak at 2.73 m. at 5:39 pm. The strong northwesterly winds created a storm surge which peaked at about 1.2 metres above normal, at 3.8 metres at Outer Harbor, the highest level since 2007.<ref name=ABC2016-05-10b>[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-05-10/storm-conditions-ease-after-wild-night-across-sa/7399716?section=sa SA weather: Storm conditions ease as authorities restore power after wild night] ''ABC News'', 10 May 2016.</ref>

The dunes at Tennyson and West Beach were heavily eroded.

==Port River flooding==

===Birkenhead===
As the amount of rainfall was limited, the flooding which occurred was caused by seawater from the Port River overflowing through stormwater drains. The Birkenhead Tavern's car park and 17 homes in Birkenhead and Semaphore were flooded, and the Birkenhead Bridge was closed due to flooding across the road.

===Mutton Cove===

The seawall at the [[Mutton Cove|Mutton Cove Conservation Reserve]] had previously been badly eroded  in several places on its river-facing side.  The king tide of 9 May finally breached the seawall at the southernmost erosion hotspot, and within the reserve the E-W walking track was also breached. Around 90% of the reserve was flooded at the time, and subsequent tidal flows are unrestricted, causing continuing erosion of the seawall and deepening of the tidal channel.
