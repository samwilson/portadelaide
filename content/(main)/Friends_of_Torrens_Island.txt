The formation of the '''Friends of Torrens Island''' (FOTI) community volunteer group occurred in 2011, in response to proposals in 2009 by then-State Treasurer [[wikipedia:Kevin Foley (South Australian politician)|Kevin Foley]] to carve up the heritage-listed [[Torrens Island Quarantine Station]] (TIQS) site for industrial development.<ref>[[File:Torrens Island Summary - 2011-11-15.pdf|Torrens Island Summary - 2011-11-15]] Compilation of materials relating to the development proposals, prepared for FoTI.</ref> With support from the [[Port of Adelaide National Trust Branch|Port of Adelaide Branch]] of the National Trust of SA and the [[Port Adelaide Residents Environment Protection Group]], FoTI was launched at a community picnic at TIQS on 29 January 2012.

The FoTI group became incorporated in September 2013, and is an affiliate member group of [[wikipedia:Friends of Parks|Friends of Parks Inc.]], the umbrella organisation for 'Friends' volunteer community groups assisting the [[wikipedia:Department for Environment and Water (South Australia)|Department for Environment and Water]] (DEW, formerly DEWNR) in looking after parks in South Australia's [[wikipedia:Protected areas of South Australia|Protected Areas System]].

After ownership of TIQS was transferred to the [[wikipedia:Department of Planning, Transport and Infrastructure|Department of Planning, Transport & Infrastructure]] (DPTI), in June 2016 FoTI signed a Licence Agreement with DPTI which gave the group a role in looking after the site. Since 2017 FOTI has been assisted in this role by [[wikipedia:Conservation Volunteers Australia|Conservation Volunteers Australia]].

This work has consisted in removing various woody weeds and other Declared Weeds<ref>[http://www.naturalresources.sa.gov.au/files/2475b040-d7a7-4daf-9f74-a1b300f8fd8f/pests-declared-plants-fact.pdf Declared plants of South Australia - are they on your land?] Dept. of Environment, Water and Natural Resources. Retrieved 22 March 2018.</ref>, and in slashing grassy weeds in the heritage precinct to reduce the fire hazard and improve visitor amenity. Garden beds and lawns at Refshauge House are being restored, and a new path is being constructed to connect the Mortuary with the historic TIQS cemetery, located in the adjacent [[Torrens Island Conservation Park|Conservation Park]].

In January 2018 FoTI received a grant from the [[wikipedia:List of South Australian government agencies#Department of the Premier and Cabinet|Premier's Office]] for purchase of a ride-on mower, to assist the group in maintaining the site.
