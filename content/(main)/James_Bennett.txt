PORT ADELAIDE FRIENDLY SOCIETIES' DEMONSTRATION.
A grand demonstration and athletic sports meeting in connection with the friendly Societies of Port Adelaide was held on the Alberton Oval on Easter Monday and proved, though to a certain extent an innovation, a success. In past years it has been customary for the Independent Order of Oddfellows to have a picnic as a separate order during Easter; but tbe managing committee, deeming wisely that union is strength, determined on a united demonstration this year, and it is proposed to make it an annual affair, the proceeds accruing from the sports to be used towards defraying the expenses of a recreation ground for the Port friendly societies. Acorn Lodge, U.A.O.D. — Messrs J. Bennett P.A; C. Brooks, P.A; J. G. Brooks, G.P.A.
