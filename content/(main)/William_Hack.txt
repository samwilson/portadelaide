He was nominated by the Working Menâ€™s Association 

Mr. William Baron Hack, who died at his residence, Lipson-street, Port Adelaide, on Tuesday morning, was for many years a prominent member of the Port Adelaide Working Men's Association. He joined that body at the time of its formation, and he also took a leading part in the establishment of the Port Adelaide Coasting Seamen's Union, which subsequently was absorbed by the Federated Seamen's Union. For many years he kept a boarding-house on the North-parade, Port. Mr. Hack was   some time ago elected a life member of the Working Men's Association.
