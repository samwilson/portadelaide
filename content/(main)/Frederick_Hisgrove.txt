DYING LIKE A MAN.

Mrs. A. Hisgrove, New-street, Queenstown, whose husband, Lance-Corporal Hisgrove, was killed recently in France, has received a letter of sympathy from Lieutenant W. Caldwell, who since forwarding it has himself fallen on the field of battle. Lieutenant Caldwell remarks: "I met one of the battalion officers who saw Fred (Lance-Corporal Hisgrove) killed, and he said Fred went over with the rest of his company in a charge. He got through that all right, but when it was over there was an officer lying out in a shell hole wounded. Fred and another stretcher bearer got to him but in coming back Fred was killed. That is dying like a man.
