==About the Wiki==
The '''''Port Adelaide Environment & Heritage Wiki''''' was started on 17 May 2015 on behalf of the Port of Adelaide Branch of the National Trust of South Australia, and is still under construction. 

It's been created because [[Port Adelaide Wiki:About|''Wikipedia'' has a number of shortcomings]], particularly in scaling down to the local level, and in capturing local content in an integrated way.

It also faces other criticisms - see, for example, [http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-03-07/women-erased-from-history-on-wikipedia/7225556 Why women are missing from history on Wikipedia] ''ABC News'', 7 March 2016.

===Wiki functionality===

This wiki uses the same basic software as ''Wikipedia'' and shares a lot of the same functionality, so users will find much that is familiar, including page layout, site navigation and editing functions. 

Over time we hope to train and build a community of contributors to build up this shared resource. so that others can learn, appreciate and enjoy the rich cultural, social and natural heritage values of Port Adelaide and the surrounding region.

Basic training sessions in editing the wiki are being held at the Port Adelaide Library.
To register your interest, please contact Meredith Blundell, the [http://www.portenf.sa.gov.au/page.aspx?u=2357 Local History Officer at the Port Adelaide Library].
