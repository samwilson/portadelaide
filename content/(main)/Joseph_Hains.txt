Port Adelaide Mayoralty.

Mr. JOSEPH HAINS.

For close on half a century has the subject of our sketch resided at Port Adelaide, and during that long period he has been identified with many important movements at this sea port. He was there in its infancy; has grown and prospered with it; until now, in its full bloom of town manhood, there are few citizens better able to set it a course and take a trick at the municipal wheel than he. 

Mr. Joseph Hains was born in Poplar, London, in 1846, and is consequently in his fifty-third year. 

He arrived in Melbourne with his parents in 1852, and came to Port Adelaide the same year, where he has since resided. He was educated at the schools conducted by Messrs. Caterer and King, and after completing the usual school course he went into the store owned by his father, the late Mr. Charles Hains, for commercial training. He was thus engaged until the year 1867, when he took over the Dock Hotel, which well-known hostelry he still keeps—a record of thirty-three years, which will bear reviewing and upon which he can look with justifiable pride. 

At an early age Mr. Hains was to the fore in union matters, and his long and honourable career in Labor societies is worthy of recapitulation. He assisted in the formation of the Coastal Seamen's Union, was appointed treasurer, and remained in that office until the union amalgamated with the Federated Seamen's Union. He joined the Port Adelaide Working Men's Association at its inauguration on August 19, 1872, and was soon singled out for promotion to a post of trust by being elected treasurer, a position he continued to fill for a number of years with strict integrity and business aptitude. For his services in this connection he was twice honored by the association. In 1876 he was presented with a handsome gold medal, bearing the following inscription:—" Presented to J. Hains for services rendered as treasurer. 1876." Four years later he was made the recipient of another token of the esteem in which he was held, the Working Men's Association presenting him with a massive silver tea and coffee set, inscribed—"Presented to Joseph Hains by the Working Men's Association for past services rendered as treasurer. 1880." He continued to fulfil the duties of treasurer in this powerful Labor association until 1893, when he resigned, retaining his full member ship and his interest in the Accidental Fund. 

During the maritime strike, in 1890, Mr. Hains had a trying time of it, and the services he then rendered are not likely to be forgotten by the men of Port Adelaide. Labor's craft at this period was beating about in a high sea, the noise of the capital MORE
