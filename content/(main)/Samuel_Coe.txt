===Contemporary press clippings:===
Mr. Samuel C. Coe (the assistant-Secretary of the South Australian branch of the Federated Seamen's Union) died at his residence in Pelham street, Glanville, early yesterday morning after a short illness. For the last few weeks he had not been able to attend his office, and his duties were carried out by Mr. J. Peters.

Mr. Coe who was well known, was of a genial disposition, and his sudden end, no doubt, will occasion surprise and regret among his wide circle, of friends. Born in London 53 years ago, he came to Australia when 21 years old. For a quarter of a century he served as an A.B. in the interstate trade, chiefly on vessels owned by the Adelaide Steamship Company, including the old Adelaide, Innamincka and Bullarra. 

On several vessels he held the position of boatswain, but a little over five years ago he, being a stanch unionist, was appointed to the assistant secretary ship of the South Australian branch of the Federated Seamen's Union, the secretary being Senator Guthrie. He was the warden representing the seamen on the Marine Board, and was for many years a member of the Naval Reserve. 

In Labor affairs he always took a deep interest, having represented the Seamen's Union on the Port Adelaide Trades and Labor Council. For the Labor Party he was a good worker, and at the last Federal election he was one of the scrutineers in the interests of the Labor candidates. Besides being a justice of the peace, he was also a Freemason.
