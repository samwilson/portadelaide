HORSES IN ACTION. DISPLAY AT ALBERTON OVAL.
A horses-in Action and sports gathering, promoted by the Port Adelaide Drivers Union, was held at the Alberton Oval on Saturday afternoon. It was the first time in the history of the seaport that such an ambitious programme was presented, and though the attendance did not aggregate much over 1,000 the success achieved should encourage the promoters to repeat the show next, year. On the whole, the exhibition was an excellent one, but considerable time was wasted, and the program instead of being completed at 5.30, was not finally dealt with, until an hour later. The majority of spectators had then left the oval. Large entries were received for most of the horses-in-action events. The officers were: Patron, the Mayor (Mr. J. H. Clouston): committee, Messrs. T. Arthur (president), H. G. Barnes, A. Craib, T, Carter, S. Brodie. E. Thomas; secretary, Mr. J. E. Stephens; assistant secretary.
