{{main|Torrens Island Concentration Camp}}

In some cases names were recorded with alternative spellings (shown in brackets)

After the Torrens Island camp was closed in August 1915, many of the internees were released, and others were transferred to a more humanely-run camp at Liverpool ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holsworthy,_New_South_Wales#History Holsworthy] ) in New South Wales.
Later detainees were sent directly to Liverpool, although a few were held at [[Fort Largs]].
