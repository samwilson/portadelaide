A military person infobox may be used to summarize information about an individual military person, such as a soldier or military leader.

This template may be used as a module (sub-template) of {{tl|Infobox person}}; see [[Wikipedia:Infobox modules]] for guidance on such usage.

The infobox otherwise should be added using the {{tl|Infobox military person}} template, as shown below:

<pre style = overflow:auto>

'''Note''': When using parameters, avoid the ambiguous abbreviation "N/A", and instead use "unknown" or "none". All subjective or qualitative judgements and numerical quantities or statistics must be cited to a reliable source (see [[WP:MILMOS#CITE]]). Please keep in mind [[WP:ICONDECORATION]] for the use of images.

* '''honorific_prefix''' – titles such as "Sir", "General".
* '''name''' – the full name of the person.
* '''honorific_suffix''' – post-nominal honours such as "OBE"
* '''image''' – ''optional'' – an image of the person.  The image must be given in the form <code><nowiki>Example.jpg</nowiki></code>; an image of a nation's highest award, such as the [[Medal of Honor]] or [[Victoria Cross]], may be displayed for recipients of it, especially as a placeholder.
* '''image_size''' – ''optional'' – the size of the image in px. Give the number without the px suffix (for example, ''220'' rather than ''220px'').
* '''alt''' [[Wikipedia:Alternative text for images|Alt text]], if used, must be placed here.
* '''caption''' – ''optional'' – the text to be placed below the image.
* '''native_name''' – the person's name in their own language
* '''native_name_lang''' – ISO 639-2 code e.g. "fre" or "fra" for French. If more than one, use {{Tl|lang}} for {{Para|native_name}} instead

* '''death_date''' – ''optional'' – the date of death, if applicable and known, in {{Tl|Death date and age}}.
* '''death_place''' – ''optional'' – the place where the person died.
* '''cause_of_death''' – ''optional'' – the cause of the person's death.
* '''placeofburial''' – ''optional'' – the place where the person's remains are buried or otherwise interred.
* '''placeofburial_label''' – ''optional'' – the label to use for the placeofburial field (above); this is intended to be used in cases where the remains were disposed of in a manner other than burial, and defaults to "Buried at" if not set.
* '''placeofburial_coordinates''' – ''optional'' – the precise location where the person's remains are buried or otherwise interred. {{UF-coord}}
* '''religion''' – ''optional'' – the person's religion.
* '''branch''' – ''optional'' – the service branch (Army, Navy, etc.) the person was a part of; this should be left blank for people who were not part of a formal armed service, or who predate the establishment of formal service branches.

* '''rank''' – ''optional'' – the highest rank achieved by the person unless a [[reduction in rank]] occurred (whether by punishment, voluntary, or as part of joining another military unit or military service). The rank being awarded posthumously, may be noted.  In cases where the person held different ranks in different armies, multiple ranks should be specified with dates and country noted for each. Separate multiple entries using {{Tl|Plainlist}}.
* '''service number''' – ''optional'' – the [[service number]] held by the individual during military service. Do not use data from [[WP:PRIMARY]] sources such as service records. Do not supply for living persons unless published by secondary sources such as the ''[[London Gazette]]''.

* '''commands''' – ''optional'' – for persons who are notable as commanding officers, the units they commanded.  Dates should be given if multiple notable commands were held. Separate multiple entries using {{Tl|Plainlist}}.
* '''battles''' – ''optional'' – any notable battles or wars in which the person participated.  This should be omitted if a campaignbox is used in conjunction with this template.
* '''battles_label''' – ''optional'' – the label to use for the '''battles''' field (above); defaults to "Battles/wars". Separate multiple entries using {{Tl|Plainlist}}.
* '''awards''' – ''optional'' – any ''notable'' awards or decorations the person received; exhaustive lists should be worked into the prose. Separate multiple entries using {{Tl|Plainlist}}.

* '''website''' – ''optional'' – Use {{Tl|URL}}
* '''module''' – ''optional'' – Embedded template

===Lists===
For parameters which take lists of values, such as {{para|awards}}, {{para|unit}} or {{para|commands}}:
* For unbulleted lists, use {{tl|plainlist}}. The use of the {{tag|br|s}} tag is common but semantically incorrect.
{{markup
|<nowiki>awards={{plainlist|
* Purple Heart (3 [[Oak leaf cluster|OLC]])
* Bronze Star (2 [[Oak leaf cluster|OLC]])
* [[World War II Victory Medal]]
* [[Presidential Unit Citation (United States)|Presidential Unit Citation]]
* [[Orange Lanyard|Orange Lanyard of the Royal Netherlands Army]]
}}</nowiki>
|{{plainlist|

* Bronze Star (2 [[Oak leaf cluster|OLC]])
* [[World War II Victory Medal]]

}}}}

* For bulleted lists, use the * markup:
{{markup
|<nowiki>awards=
* Purple Heart (3 [[Oak leaf cluster|OLC]])
* Bronze Star (2 [[Oak leaf cluster|OLC]])
* [[World War II Victory Medal]]
* [[Presidential Unit Citation (United States)|Presidential Unit Citation]] (2 [[Oak leaf cluster|OLC]])

=== Embedding ===
Many military people are known for more than just their military service (e.g., [[Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.]] and [[James Stewart]]), and hence it may be desirable to merge this infobox with another one, like {{tl|Infobox person}}.  By adding "''{{para|embed|yes}}''" to the first line of the infobox code, one can embed this infobox into another, creating the illusion of one continuous infobox. Though the process is a little complicated, it is possible to insert this infobox into most if not all other infoboxes.  For {{tl|Infobox person}}, this infobox is passed as a "module" using the {{para|module}} syntax.

<pre style="overflow: auto">
{{Infobox person
| name          = John Infobox
| image         = Example.jpg
| caption       = John Infobox in 2005

| birth_date    = {{Birth date|1950|5|5}}
| birth_place   = Template City
| death_date    = {{Death date and age|2010|10|10|1950|5|5}}
| occupation    = Actor
| years_active  = 1970–1990
| module        = {{Infobox military person|embed=yes
| allegiance    = {{Flag|United States of America}}

| website       = {{URL|example.com}}
}}
}}
</pre>
The title for the embedded section can be changed using {{para|embed_title}}.
