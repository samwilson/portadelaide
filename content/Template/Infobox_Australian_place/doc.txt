{{Template:Infobox Australian place/pagelinks}}

== Purpose ==
{{tl|Infobox Australian place}} is used to add infoboxes to articles on [[Location (geography)|places]] in Australian states and territories. It is not limited to populated places such as cities, towns and suburbs, but may be used on any place including regions, [[Local government in Australia|local government areas]], [[Lands administrative divisions of Australia|cadastral units]], [[protected area]]s and even some areas that do not fall into any of the preceding descriptions and for which no other infobox is appropriate. It is the standard infobox used in Australian articles. Australian articles using {{tl|Infobox settlement}} should be converted to use this infobox.

The infobox been extensively customised for Australia and includes automation that results in some parameters being redundant to other parameters. For example, when the location map function is used, it is not necessary to specify <code>coordinates</code> as the coordinate string is automatically generated during creation of the locator map. Similarly, if a population density (in the <code>density</code> field) is not specified, this will be automatically generated based on the <code>pop</code> and <code>area</code> fields. It is therefore important to read parameter descriptions thoroughly, to avoid unnecessarily providing redundant, or incorrect information.

== Usage ==
=== To use this template === 
#Copy the relevant blank template from the <u>'''[[Template:Infobox Australian place/Blank|Blank infobox page]]'''</u> into the beginning of your document, remembering to put the code at the very top of the article and the first word of the article on the very next line.
#Enter values for the fields as outlined in the [[Template:Infobox Australian place#Fields|table below]]. Fields left blank will automatically be hidden.
#Preview.
#Save the page with an appropriate edit summary.

=== Examples ===
* Examples of this template can found on the [[Template:Infobox Australian place/Examples|examples page]].

=== IUCN Categories for protected areas ===
Depending on the value of the <code>iucn_category</code> parameter, one of the following banners will be displayed below the name. Valid values are Ia, Ib, II, III, IV, V and VI. For more information read the [[World Commission on Protected Areas]] article,

{| style="border:1px solid gray; width:300px; font-size: 90%; text-align: center; line-height: 1.5;"

|-
| {{IUCN banner|III}}
|-
| {{IUCN banner|IV}}
|-
| {{IUCN banner|V}}
|-
| {{IUCN banner|VI}}
|}

=== Footnotes fields ===
Any references should be placed within the respective "_footnotes" field and not within the field reserved solely for a numeric value.  For example, place the reference used for the area of City X in the parameter {{{area_footnotes}}} and not in the {{{area}}} parameter.  Otherwise, an error may result.

=== Unformatted numbers and expression errors ===
Certain fields require numeric values to be entered in an unformatted/raw fashion—i.e. 1000.0 NOT 1,000.0.  If an expression error is present, simply remove any commas or spaces from the number.
<!-- === Maps ===
For some locations this infobox supports the display of links to the popular web mapping services Google and Bing. However, in order for this to function a valid map page containing a [[Keyhole Markup Language|KML]] format map must exist. As KML files cannot currently be uploaded, the text of those files must be copied into a Wikipedia page. By default, the infobox uses a file name with the same title as the article at the location <code>Template:Infobox Australian place/mapdata/<place name></code> e.g. [[Raymond Terrace, New South Wales]] uses [[Template:Infobox Australian place/mapdata/Raymond Terrace, New South Wales]]. A list of currently available maps may be found [[Template:Infobox Australian place/mapdata|here]]. -->

=== Dist#, Dir# and Location# ===
This is the distance and approximate direction to another location. The '#' is replaced with a number between 1 and 5. Therefore distances for up to five locations can be listed using the range 'dist1' – 'dist5'. Direction from the locations can be specified use 'dir1' – 'dir5' and the locations can be listed as 'location1' – 'location5'. Each dist# must be partnered with an appropriate location#. Dir# is optional.
