* <span id="csdoc_publisher" />'''publisher''': Name of publisher; may be wikilinked if relevant. The [[publisher]] is the company that publishes the work being cited. Do not use the '''publisher''' parameter for the name of a work (e.g. a book, encyclopedia, newspaper, magazine, journal, website). Not normally used for periodicals. Corporate designations such as "Ltd", "Inc" or "GmbH" are not usually included. Omit where the publisher's name is substantially the same as the name of the work (for example, The New York Times Co. publishes ''The New York Times'' newspaper, so there is no reason to name the publisher). Displays after '''title'''{{#ifeq:{{{work|}}}|no|.|<nowiki />; if '''work''' is defined, then '''publisher''' is enclosed in parentheses.}}
* <span id="csdoc_location" /><span id="csdoc_place" />'''place''': Geographical place of publication; generally not wikilinked; omit when the name of the work includes the location; examples: ''The Boston Globe'', ''The Times of India''. Displays after the title; if '''work''' is defined, then '''location''' is enclosed in parentheses. Alias: '''location'''
* <span id="csdoc_publication-place" />'''publication-place''': If any one of '''publication-place''', '''place''' or '''location''' are defined, then the location shows after the title; if '''publication-place''' and '''place''' or '''location''' are defined, then '''place''' or '''location''' are shown before the title prefixed with "written at" and '''publication-place''' is shown after the title.
* <span id="csdoc_publication-date" />'''publication-date''': Date of publication when different from the date the work was written. Displays only if '''year''' or '''date''' are defined and only if different, else '''publication-date''' is used and displayed as '''date'''.  Use the same format as other dates in the article; do not wikilink. Follows '''publisher'''; if '''work''' is not defined, then '''publication-date''' is preceded by "published" and enclosed in parenthesis.
* <span id="csdoc_via" />'''via''': Name of the content deliverer (if ''different'' from '''publisher'''). '''via''' is not a replacement for '''publisher''', but provides additional detail. It may be used when the content deliverer presents the source in a format other than the original (e.g. [[NewsBank]]), when the URL provided does not make clear the identity of the deliverer, where no URL or DOI is available (EBSCO), if the deliverer requests attribution, or as requested in [[WP:The Wikipedia Library]] (e.g. [[WP:Credo accounts/Citations|Credo]], [[HighBeam]]). See also '''registration''' and '''subscription'''.
