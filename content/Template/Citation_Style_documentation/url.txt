* <span id="csdoc_url" />'''url''': URL of an online location where the text of the publication can be found. Cannot be used if '''title''' is wikilinked. If applicable, the link may point to the specific page(s) referenced. Remove spurious tracking parameters from URLs, e.g. <code>#ixzz2rBr3aO94</code> or <code>?utm_source=google&utm_medium=...&utm_term=...&utm_campaign=...</code>. Do not link to any commercial booksellers, such as Amazon.com. See: [[WP:PAGELINKS]].
** <span id="csdoc_accessdate" />'''access-date''': Full date when the content pointed to by '''url''' was last verified to support the text in the article; do not wikilink; requires '''url'''; use the same format as other access and archive dates in the citations.{{r|date|group=date}}  ''Not required for linked documents that do not change.'' For example, '''access-date''' is not required for links to copies of published research papers accessed via DOI or a published book, but should be used for links to news articles on commercial websites (these can change from time to time, even if they are also published in a physical medium). Note that '''access-date''' is the date that the URL was checked to not just be working, but to support the assertion being cited (which the current version of the page may not do). Can be [[Help:Citation Style 1/accessdate|hidden or styled]] by registered editors. Alias: '''accessdate'''.
** <span id="csdoc_archiveurl" />'''archive-url''': The URL of an [[Web archiving|archived]] copy of a web page, if or in case the url becomes unavailable. Typically used to refer to services like [[WebCite]] (see: [[Wikipedia:Using WebCite]]) and [[Internet Archive]] (see: [[Wikipedia:Using the Wayback Machine]]); requires '''archive-date''' and '''url'''. Alias: '''archiveurl'''.
*** <span id="csdoc_archivedate" />'''archive-date''': Date when the original URL was archived; preceded by default text "archived from the original on". Use the same format as other access and archive dates in the citations. This does not necessarily have to be the same format that was used for citing publication dates.{{r|date|group=date}} Do not wikilink. Alias: '''archivedate'''.
*** <span id="csdoc_deadurl" />'''dead-url''': When the URL is still live, but pre-emptively archived, then set {{para|dead-url|no}}. This changes the display order with the title retaining the original link and the archive linked at the end. Alias: '''deadurl'''.
** <span id="csdoc_template doc demo" />'''template-doc-demo''': The archive parameters will be error checked to ensure that all the required parameters are included, or else {{tl|citation error}} is invoked. With errors, main, help and template pages are placed into one of the subcategories of [[:Category:Articles with incorrect citation syntax]]. Set {{para|template-doc-demo|true}} to disable categorization; mainly used for documentation where the error is demonstrated.
* <span id="csdoc_format" />'''format''': Format of the work referred to by '''url'''; for example: PDF, DOC, or XLS; displayed in parentheses after '''title'''. HTML is implied and should not be specified. Automatically added when a PDF icon is displayed.  Does not change the [[Help:External link icons|external link icon]]. Note: External link icons do not include [[Wikipedia:ALT|alt text]]; thus, they do not add format information for the visually impaired.
