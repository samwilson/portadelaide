Nested parameters rely on their parent parameters:
*''parent''
*OR: ''parent2''—may be used instead of ''parent''
**''child''—may be used with ''parent'' (and is ignored if ''parent'' is not used)
**OR: ''child2''—may be used instead of ''child'' (and is ignored if ''parent2'' is not used)

:Where aliases are listed, only one of the parameters may be defined; if multiple aliased parameters are defined, then only one will show.
