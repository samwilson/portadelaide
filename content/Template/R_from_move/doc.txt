__NOTOC__
=== Usage ===
{{hatnote|Use this rcat template in '''any [[wp:namespace|namespace]]'''.}}
* This redirect category ([[WP:RCAT|rcat]]) template populates {{Cat|Redirects from moves}}, which is used to track all page moves that, if a redirect is not left behind, would result in the breakage of links, both internal [[WP:wikilink|wikilink]]s and external [[URL|internet website links]].
* For [[WP:redirect pages|redirect]]s that have been left behind from page moves and have not yet been categorized, add this rcat in the following manner:
<pre>
#REDIRECT [[(target page name)]]

{{Redr|from move}}
</pre>
: Template {{tl|Redr}} is an alias for the ''This is a redirect'' template, which may be used to add up to seven appropriate rcats, along with their parameters, to a redirect.  For more information see the documentation on its template page and its [[Template:This is a redirect/Comparison|comparison page]].  This rcat may also tag a redirect individually:
<pre>
#REDIRECT [[(target page name)]]

{{R from move}}
</pre>
: This is in accord with instructions found at [[Wikipedia:REDCAT]].
* Use this rcat to tag any redirect in any namespace that has been left behind as the result of a [[WP:Moving pages|page move (rename)]].  This tagging has become automated; however, there are still many older redirects from moves that need to be manually tagged by this rcat.

==== Aliases ====
* <span class="plainlinks">[{{fullurl:Special:WhatLinksHere/Template:R_from_move|hidetrans=1&hidelinks=1&limit=500}} Also known as...]</span> â€“ list of templates that redirect here and may also be used

=== Printworthiness ===
* In [[wp:mainspace|main-article namespace]], many redirects from moved pages are considered unprintworthy; however, there are many others that are printworthy, so there is no default sort for [[wp:printworthiness|printworthiness]].  At some point in the future, [[Jimmy Wales]] wants to make more {{diff|Wikipedia:Pushing to 1.0||1319195|printed versions}} of ''Wikipedia'' encyclopedia articles.  Some rcats automatically populate either {{Cat|Printworthy redirects}} or {{Cat|Unprintworthy redirects}} by default.  Others, like this rcat, do not, and that means it is up to editors to choose which of those categories, ''Printworthy'' or ''Unprintworthy'', is appropriate and should be populated.  The rcats that are used separately to populate those categories are: 
:* {{tlx|R printworthy}} and
:* {{tlx|R unprintworthy}}
: Please click on each one for more details and guidance.
* Template {{tl|This is a redirect}} will accept these rcats just like any other.
:: '''Examples:'''
<pre>
{{Redr|from move|printworthy}}
{{Redr|from move|unprintworthy}}
</pre>
: Either {{tl|This is a redirect}} or its alias/shortcut, {{tl|Redr}}, may be used.

=== TemplateData ===

	"params": {},
	"description": "Places this redirect in the category [[Category:Redirects from moves]]. It takes no parameters."
}
</templatedata>
