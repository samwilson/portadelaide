==Infobox bridge - Example 2==
(See below for the original Sydney Harbour Bridge example, which copied directly from the example at the bottom of this page: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Infobox_bridge|<nowiki>Template Infobox bridge</nowiki>] Note that even this doesn't display in the same way as the original in Wikipedia.)

I've overwritten it with the data for the Birkenhead Bridge, but it still isn't displaying properly, as more errors have crept in somewhere.

(17June 2015)
N.B.: Use only "| coordinates_display = inline" and not "| coordinates_display = inline, title" otherwise get repetition of coords in infobox.

In Template:Infobox bridge, changed headerstyle = background-color from "#efefefe" to "#cfcfcf"
This now seems suitable for use.

==Infobox template==

===What works===
images display - OK

distance conversion templates - OK

map pin on location map - OK

===What doesn't work===
infobox not aligned on RHS - '''FIXED'''

No border around infobox - '''FIXED'''

Font size too big - '''FIXED'''

location map for SA doesn't display - '''FIXED'''

text not constrained within infobox border - '''FIXED'''

==Here's another template that needs fixing==
